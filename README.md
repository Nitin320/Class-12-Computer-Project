# Class-12-Computer-Project

This is basically the project that i created for my external practicals in class 12. 

This is a bank management system that gives you the facility to create an account, add money, withdraw money, check your account balance and also gives you
the option to update your accounts information. 

This also involves SQL as all your account information will be sent to a database.

Guess that justifies the 220 lines of code...
